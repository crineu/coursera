coursera
========

Repo created as a house to all material used in online courses. These online courses are awesome. Some people call them MMOC.

Maybe they're called MOOC.

Or MOCC. Really, I'm lost here.


gh-pages
------

The **gh-pages** branch holds a nice page made for some specific week (*9*) of some specific course (*Think again: How to Reason and Argue*) of some specific online institution (**Coursera**, in this case).

It's really nice.

All other files may or may not receive updates, at undetermined time.

Okay. Now I present you with a cool icon and leave using the back door.
